## Completed — Session 2026-06-21 → 2026-06-23 (Issue #351: Freemium / Pro unlock)

Shipped the freemium model: 12-contact free tier + one-time non-consumable **Pro** unlock (StoreKit 2). Built across 6 stages, bundled into a single umbrella PR **#359** and squash-merged to `main` (commit `3f26716`). Grandfathered TestFlight users get Pro free via a write-once flag. Device QA passed (pre + post purchase). Both `/code-review high` + `/security-review` ran on the full feature diff vs main → PASS.

- [x] **Stage 1** Entitlement foundation — Core Data v11 (`isGrandfathered`/`proStatusEvaluated`), `GrandfatherEvaluator`, `Entitlements.isPro`, App Group `EntitlementCache`, `EntitlementBootstrap`, `ProConfig`
- [x] **Stage 2** StoreKit 2 — `StoreKitGateway` seam + `LiveStoreKitGateway`, `@MainActor PurchaseManager` (authoritative cache writer), `Configuration.storekit`
- [x] **Stage 3** Paywall + 12-contact cap — `PaywallView`/`PaywallTrigger`, `ContactCapGate`, `PersonRepository.trackedCount()`
- [x] **Stage 4** Feature gates — onboarding cap, stats, file import, bulk logging
- [x] **Stage 5** In-detail gates — pause, custom due dates, custom cadences, snooze, custom notif time (SET gated; clear/unpause/undo stay free — never trap an ex-Pro user)
- [x] **Stage 6 (PR6)** Widget gates — birthday + lock-screen/StandBy widgets are Pro (upsell placeholder + `keepintouch://paywall`); Overdue home widget stays free; `PurchaseManager` reloads widgets on entitlement change

### Lessons captured from #351
- StoreKit entitlement changes need an explicit widget reload (repo-layer `WidgetRefresher` only fires on Core Data saves)
- Gate Pro widgets in the entry view, not the provider (`supportedFamilies` is compile-time static)
- Single-merge umbrella PR pattern for a stacked feature; a required CI check with no producing workflow blocks all merges (needs `--admin`)

### Follow-ups deferred from #351
- [ ] **#360** Fix stale widget-accent API comment in `OverdueLockScreenWidget` (tech debt, comment-only)
- [ ] **#353** Manual $7.99 → $9.99 price cutover (ASC, no app logic)
- [ ] **Manual prereq (pre-release)** Create ASC non-consumable IAP `slavins.co.KeepInTouch.pro` ($7.99, Family Sharing on) + active Paid Apps Agreement
- [ ] **#349** Land the CI pipeline — still open; needs one `--admin` merge to break the required-check deadlock on `main` (every PR to main is BLOCKED until then)

## Completed — Session 2026-05-27 → 2026-05-28 (Issue #302: Tech-debt audit sweep)

Closed the full `/simplify` audit (#302). 13 child issues (#307-#319), 12 substantive PRs + 1 Swift-6 hotfix merged; #319 closed without a PR (findings resolved by prior waves or schema-blocked). North star held: zero observable behavior change, every PR manually QA'd against `main`.

**Execution model:** 5 waves of parallel worktree executor sub-agents (implement → context7 doc check → build/test → review loop → manual QA → squash merge). Reviews ran as sub-agents with a score-70 auto-fix loop.

- [x] **R2, R3, R4, R8** Shared helpers (`Person.isSnoozed`, `FrequencyCalculator.daysUntilDue`, `Color.normalize(hex:)`, `CoreDataMappingHelpers.requiredField`) — PR #322
- [x] **R1** Repository CRUD base (`CoreDataRepositoryHelpers` free helpers) — PR #323
- [x] **E10, E15, HomeView dupe fetch** Formatter caching + cold-launch — PR #320
- [x] **R5** Status drift — `PersonStatusService.partition` unifies Home buckets — PR #321
- [x] **Swift 6 hotfix** `TouchMethod: Sendable` declared in source (retroactive AppEnum conformance was a strict-mode error) — PR #326
- [x] **Q5, Q6, Q7, Q8** View component extraction (`FloatingSearchBar`, `timeAgoText`, `TouchTimeAndNotesFields`, `ContactAccessAlerts`) — PR #324
- [x] **E1, E5, E7** PersonDetailVM in-place updates + NotificationScheduler debounce + batched CNContact fetch — PR #325
- [x] **E4, E8, E12, E6** Batch saves (ContactsSync, deletePerson cascade, addPeople, TaskGroup notification add) — PR #327
- [x] **E2, E3, E9, E13** List-render efficiency (`ContactsListViewModel` derived state, dict-based FrequencyCalculator overloads, `count(for:)`) — PR #328
- [x] **Q13, Q10-12, R7, R9, R12** Stringly + magic numbers (`UserInfoKey`/`UserInfoValue` enums, `DS.Timing`/`DS.Motion` tokens, `PhoneNormalizer.dialableDigits`, `Date.defaultSnoozeStartDate`, unified avatar palette) — PR #330
- [x] **Q14, Q15, N2** DI / layering (`AppDependencies.shared`, `BackgroundWorkScheduler` protocol restores Domain/Data boundary) — PR #331
- [x] **Q9** `ViewModelErrorHandling` helper — 9 VMs migrated, ~115 LOC boilerplate removed — PR #332
- [x] **Q1** Person initializer split — 27 flat params → 4 nested config structs (Identity/TouchState/NotificationConfig/Metadata) — PR #333
- [x] **Q2, Q3, E14** Tier-3 — closed #319 without a PR: Q2 already consolidated by #324/#325, Q3 resolved by #328/E9, E14 schema-blocked (Transformable `tagIds`, zero production callers)

**Net diff (pre `370dd2a` → post `8f84275`):** 88 Swift files, +2728 / −1473. Source +2075/−1077, tests +653/−396. 10 new abstraction files. `CoreDataStack.shared.viewContext` DI-bypass defaults: 27 → 0. `requiredField` definitions: 4 → 1.

### Deferred (Tier 4, not filed)
- **E14 join-entity migration** — denormalize `tagIds` into a queryable join entity so `fetchByGroup` can use an SQLite predicate. Requires Core Data schema migration. No production callers today, so low priority.

## Completed — Session 2026-05-20 (Issue #138: Stats & Insights v1)

- [x] **#138** Settings → Insights destination with 30d/90d range toggle — PR #306 (pending manual QA / merge)
  - REDUCE-mode plan-review locked v1 scope to 2 metric families: per-cadence "Performance vs Intent" bars + "How you showed up" method breakdown donut. Streaks, leaderboards, trends-over-time, lifetime totals, per-person momentum, custom date pickers all deferred — file separately if v1 lands
  - `StatsRange` enum with `startDate(now:)` helper — single source of truth for "events at or after this date are in range." Subtitle copy ties each window to the cadences it best surfaces (30d → Weekly + Biweekly; 90d → Monthly + Quarterly)
  - `StatsSnapshot` Codable value type — three states (`.empty`, `.emptyForRange`, `.ready`) with `CadenceRow` (id, name, frequencyDays, trackedCount, expected, actual, ratio: Double?) + `MethodRow` (method, count, percent)
  - `StatsCalculator` — pure use case, no Core Data import. Filters `isTracked && !isPaused` for the expected denominator; returns `ratio = nil` when range < cadence frequency (UI shows "Range too short" instead of fake 0% or 100%). Over-performing ratios (>1.0) preserved in data; only visually capped
  - `TouchEventRepository.fetchAll(since:)` — new range-scoped fetch, predicate `at >= since`, `fetchBatchSize = 200`, sort descending. Boundary inclusive (`>=`), verified with explicit test
  - `StatsViewModel` — @MainActor, repo-injected. `fetchTracked(includePaused: false)` (post-simplify) so the calculator doesn't waste work on archived contacts. Reloads on `.onAppear`, on `.onChange(of: range)`, and on `.personDidChange` notification
  - `StatsView` + `CadencePerformanceChart` (BarMark, range-scaled 0...1, ✓ Ahead pill when over, "Range too short" when nil ratio) + `MethodBreakdownChart` (donut SectorMark with `innerRadius: .ratio(0.6)` + adjacent legend). DS tokens throughout, no `colorScheme` conditionals, no fixed font sizes. Per-row/segment accessibility labels
  - Empty states use the existing `EmptyStateView` component (caught by simplify pass)
  - 21 new unit tests: `StatsCalculatorTests` (12) + `StatsViewModelTests` (4) + `CoreDataTouchEventRepositoryTests.fetchAll(since:)` (5)
- [x] Code review (sub-agent): PASS — 0 blockers. 3 sub-70 informational notes only (unused `LoadState.failed`, unused `convenience init(dependencies:)`, defensive double-filter in calculator). None acted on
- [x] Simplify pass (sub-agent): 3 changes pushed in commit `93b4e4f` — hoisted range-start math into `StatsRange.startDate(now:)` (was inlined in VM + calculator), reused existing `EmptyStateView` for empty/empty-for-range states, switched VM to `fetchTracked(includePaused: false)` instead of `fetchAll()`. All tests still green after
- [x] Security review (sub-agent): PASS — 0 findings. Read-only Core Data fetch with parameterized predicate; no new network surface, no external input, no file I/O. Consistent with the "local-only iOS app = PASS by default" precedent
- [ ] Manual QA — see PR #306 description for the 10-scenario checklist (Brad's morning pass)

### Lessons captured from #138

- **`@MainActor`-isolated init can't be used as a default arg in a non-MainActor struct init** under Swift 6 strict concurrency. SwiftUI `View` structs are NOT implicitly `@MainActor` for default-arg evaluation purposes. Symptom: "call to main actor-isolated initializer in a synchronous nonisolated context" on the View init's signature line. Fix: drop the default value and require callers to pass the VM explicitly — `StatsView(viewModel: StatsViewModel())`. Marking the init `@MainActor` does NOT fix it. `@autoclosure` also doesn't help because the default expression still has to type-check at the call site
- **Apple Charts (`BarMark` / `SectorMark`) first-time integration**: `import Charts` only; deployment target 17.0 has it built-in. For horizontal bars use `BarMark(xStart:, xEnd:, y:)` + `.chartXScale(domain: 0...1)` to constrain a normalized range. For donut: `SectorMark(angle:innerRadius:)` with `.ratio(0.6)` inner radius reads lighter than a solid pie when paired with an adjacent legend. Per-mark `.foregroundStyle(Color)` works on both. Skip `accessibilityChartDescriptor` for simple charts — per-row/segment `.accessibilityLabel` is enough
- **Hoist shared range/window math to the value object, not a private helper**: when a `@MainActor` VM and a pure use case both compute the same "rangeStart from now" math, put it on the range enum itself (e.g. `StatsRange.startDate(now:)`) — the use case stays pure, the VM uses it for the repo query, and the enum is the single source of truth. Caught by the simplify pass: don't let me ship the inlined duplicate next time
- **Empty states have a reusable `EmptyStateView` component** — when a new view needs an empty/null-state placeholder, grep for `EmptyStateView` before building a fresh `VStack { Image; Text; Text }`. Existing component handles centering, padding, and Dynamic Type
- **`.personDidChange` is the canonical "data may have changed" notification** in this app — posted by every touch-logging flow (`PersonDetailViewModel`, `BulkLogTouchUseCase` via repo, App Intents). Any new view that needs to refresh on touch logging should `.onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: .personDidChange))` — don't invent a new notification or subscribe to Core Data `didSave` directly

## Completed — Session 2026-05-20 (Issue #304: App Intents v1 for iOS Shortcuts)

- [x] **#304** Expose Keep In Touch's core actions as App Intents — PR #305 (pending manual QA / merge)
  - `LogTouchIntent` — log a touch via Siri / Shortcuts / Action Button / Spotlight. Reuses `BulkLogTouchUseCase.applyTouch` via a thin `IntentActions` facade — same headline-recompute helper as `PersonDetailViewModel.logTouch`, zero logic duplication
  - `GetOverdueContactsIntent` / `GetDueSoonContactsIntent` — return `[PersonAppEntity]` for Shortcut chains. Due-soon uses `PersonStatusService.dueSoonPeople` (same classifier as Home tab)
  - `OpenPersonIntent` — deep-links via existing `DeepLinkRouter.shared.pending`; stale-id fallback routes to Home and throws `IntentError.personNotFound`
  - `KeepInTouchShortcuts: AppShortcutsProvider` — curated phrases for Spotlight / Siri discoverability (one parameter per phrase per Apple's metadata processor)
  - `IntentContainer` — lazy DI singleton with `install` / `reset` / `make` test seam. Memberwise init added to `AppDependencies` for mock injection
  - `PersonAppEntity` + `PersonAppEntityQuery` (`EntityStringQuery`) with capped `suggestedEntities()` (12 most-recent) to keep Siri cold launches snappy
  - `TouchMethod.verb` lives next to the AppEnum case mapping — single source of truth for "Logged a {verb} with X" dialog phrasing across any future intent
  - `PersonListDialog.make(...)` — shared zero/one/many phrasing helper for GetOverdue + GetDueSoon, ready for any future query intent
  - 24 new unit tests: LogTouchIntent (6) + IntentActions (2) + PersonAppEntityQuery (6) + OpenPersonIntent (2) + GetOverdue (3) + GetDueSoon (2) + IntentContainer (3)
- [x] Code review: PASS — 0 blockers (no 70+ findings). 5 sub-70 polish items fixed inline (redundant Set check, RelativeDateTimeFormatter hoisted to static, analytics test seam, divergence comment honesty, phrase-limit doc)
- [x] Simplify pass (reuse + quality + efficiency, 3 parallel agents): PASS — 0 blockers. Moved `methodVerb` to `TouchMethod.verb`, extracted `PersonListDialog`, capped `suggestedEntities`, parallelized GetDueSoon's two fetches via `async let`
- [x] Security review (run via sub-agent wrapper for autonomy resilience): PASS — 0 findings (critical/high/medium/low). All 9 threat-model surfaces cleared
- [ ] Manual QA — see PR #305 description for the 8-scenario checklist (Brad's morning pass)

### Follow-ups deferred from #304 (v2 candidates)

- [ ] **v2 toggles**: SnoozePerson, PausePerson, ResumePerson, MuteNotifications, UnmuteNotifications — file as one consolidated issue
- [ ] `SetCustomDueDateIntent`, `AddPersonToGroupIntent` — admin-grade automation; file individually if requested
- [ ] `MarkContactedTodayIntent` — users can build via `LogTouchIntent` + default method in Shortcuts editor
- [ ] `GetLastTouchIntent` — `PersonAppEntity.lastTouchAt` already exposed; defer unless users ask
- [ ] `OpenGroupIntent` — low value; defer
- [ ] Move `GroupAppEntity` to `Shared/` for both widget + main app — only needed when v2 adds Group-parameter intents
- [ ] Siri intent **donations** (`IntentDonationManager`) for on-device prediction — file when v1 usage is observed
- [ ] Custom result snippet views (e.g. streak SwiftUI view in LogTouch confirmation) — defer until dogfooding shows the plain dialog feels thin
- [ ] Interactive widgets / Control Center controls (issue #24 lives downstream of this)
- [ ] Focus filter integration, Apple Watch shortcuts, localization beyond English

### Lessons captured from #304

- App Intent phrases support exactly ONE `@Parameter` slot. Multi-parameter invocations must be entered via the Shortcuts editor; the metadata processor errors out at build time. Don't waste a phrase slot on `"Log a {method} with {person}"` — pick the single best slot per phrase
- Widget refresh is wired at the **repository layer** (`CoreDataPersonRepository.save/batchSave/delete`), not just in `BulkLogTouchUseCase`. Single-touch paths get widget refresh for free — don't add redundant `WidgetRefresher.reloadAllTimelines()` calls at view-model or use-case layer
- Wrap `/security-review` in a spawned `Agent` sub-agent when running it inside an autonomous loop. The skill has a known failure mode where it exits without posting a PR comment; the parent agent can recover by reading the sub-agent's text result and posting itself
- Core Data attribute names lag the domain rename: `PersonEntity.cadenceId` is named `groupId` in the .xcdatamodel, and `GroupEntity` (Core Data) maps to domain `Cadence`, while `TagEntity` (Core Data) maps to domain `Group`. Read the mapping files (`Data/CoreData/Mappings/`) before writing predicates against entity names

## Completed — Session 2026-05-17 → 2026-05-19 (Issue #293: Bulk Log Touch for Group Hangouts)

- [x] **#293** Log one TouchEvent against multiple people in a single flow — PR #303 squash-merged to main as `dc503d9`
  - Multi-select via "Select" filter chip on Home + "Select" header button on Contacts + long-press on rows/cards (Photos/Mail pattern)
  - `SelectionCoordinator` shared between Home + Contacts so selection carries across tabs
  - `BulkLogTouchUseCase.execute()` — fresh-batch path with newest-wins lastTouch* rule + rollback on partial failure
  - `BulkLogTouchUseCase.reconcile()` — batch-edit path (wipe-and-rewrite): deletes prior events, writes fresh ones, recomputes lastTouch* for affected persons via the shared `recomputeLastTouch` helper, with snapshot rollback if step-2 batchSave throws
  - `BulkLogTouchModal` with avatar chips (X-to-remove) above a reused single-touch form
  - `RecentGroupsStore` (UserDefaults) — last 3 distinct selections, one-tap reselection at the top of the picker; stores the *final* batch composition (post-edit), not the cumulative union
  - Success toast with "Forgot someone?" action chip — reopens picker with prior group pre-selected, carries forward method/notes/date, runs reconcile on second commit. Chained Forgot rounds supported (round 2 → round 3 → ...)
  - Subtitle "Editing last batch" + commit-label flip "Save changes" so users know they're editing, not creating
  - Helper `BulkLogTouchUseCase.recomputeLastTouch(for:from:now:)` shared with `PersonDetailViewModel.deleteTouch` — single-event undo and bulk batch-edit now flow through one source of truth
  - 11 new tests (use case happy paths, newest-wins, missing-person handling, reconcile delta + rollback + skip + edge cases, helper contract, snooze preservation)
  - 4 analytics events: `bulk_log.opened`, `bulk_log.committed`, `bulk_log.reconciled`, `forgot_someone.tapped`
- [x] Code review: 4 passes (initial, simplify, QA fixes, reconcile rework, DRY refactor) — all PASS, all sub-70 findings addressed inline
- [x] Security review: PASS — 0 exploitable findings (10 items considered)
- [x] Manual QA: 9-scenario matrix + 6 reconcile/batch-edit scenarios including date/notes change during edit pass — all passing

### Follow-ups deferred from #293

- [ ] Move `recomputeLastTouch` onto `Person` as `func recomputingLastTouch(from:now:) -> Person` (Domain layer) — drops PersonDetailViewModel's incidental dependency on BulkLogTouchUseCase. _(Code-review note, sub-70, architectural polish)_
- [ ] Stable chip ordering in `BulkLogTouchModal` — currently from `Set<UUID>` iteration, unstable between presentations. Fix when next form-field addition forces refactor anyway
- [ ] Extract shared `LogTouchFormBody` view — `BulkLogTouchModal` and `LogTouchModal` Forms duplicate the method/date/notes layout. Defer until the next form field gets added
- [ ] UI integration test for happy-path bulk log — deferred pending onboarding-bypass infrastructure
- [ ] TipKit `BulkSelectTip` for Select-chip discoverability — defer until dogfooding shows the affordance gets missed

## Completed — Session 2026-04-22 (Issue #283: Home 'All Caught Up' Banner)

- [x] **#283** Add celebratory banner on Home when tracked contacts exist but none are overdue/due-soon — matches widget's `hand.wave.fill` + "You've reached out to everyone. Way to go!" copy
  - New `AllCaughtUpView` component in `UI/Views/Home/`
  - `HomeViewModel.showsAllCaughtUpBanner` computed property gates visibility: tracked-non-empty + overdue/dueSoon empty + not during search (whitespace-only search allowed)
  - Inserted into `HomeView` content stack in place of overdue/due-soon sections; All Good list remains below
  - 5 new unit tests (fresh install / all on-track / overdue present / search active / whitespace-only search)

  - Introduced `FrequencyCalculatorPerson` / `FrequencyCalculatorCadence` protocols in `Shared/`
  - `Person` + `Cadence` conform via empty extensions (passthrough)
  - `FrequencyCalculator` moved to `Shared/`, methods generic over the protocols — 16 existing tests pass unchanged
  - `ContactStatus` moved to `Shared/`
  - `WidgetDataProvider.statusFor` rewritten to build lightweight adapter structs and delegate to `FrequencyCalculator` — widget and app now agree on `customDueDate` + grace-period (`groupAddedAt`) cases
- [x] **#286** Widget unit tests (reduced scope — `statusFor` collapsed into `FrequencyCalculatorTests` via #284)
  - Moved `WidgetDataProvider` testable core to `Shared/`; kept widget-only `loadSnapshot` wrapper in a loader file
  - New `WidgetDataProviderTests` — 12 tests covering `sortPriority` ordering, `snapshot` counts + featured prefix + pause/demo/untracked exclusion, and parity with `FrequencyCalculator` for customDueDate / grace-period / snoozed cases
- [x] Build: main app + widget compile clean
- [x] Full test suite passes (previously 341 + 12 new widget tests)
